# Binary & Decimal Calculator

This project is a **web-based calculator** developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Unlike a regular calculator, this application is designed to support **both decimal (base-10) and binary (base-2) number calculations**, making it suitable for learning and practicing concepts related to **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.

## Project Description

The Binary & Decimal Calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator accepts standard numerical expressions and can also be used to calculate binary numbers by treating them as numeric inputs.

This project helps students better understand how different number systems work and how expressions are evaluated programmatically.

## Subject Context

- **Course**: Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
- **Purpose**: To apply logical thinking and algorithmic validation in a practical application
- **Focus**: Expression evaluation, input validation, and error handling

## Features

- Supports basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (+)
  - Subtraction (-)
  - Multiplication (*)
  - Division (/)
- Can be used for:
  - **Decimal number calculations**
  - **Binary number calculations**
- Input validation to prevent invalid expressions
- Error handling with user-friendly error messages
- Clear (AC) and delete (DE) functions
- Responsive and simple user interface

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Structure of the calculator
- **CSS** – Styling and layout design
- **JavaScript** – Logic, validation, and calculation handling

## How It Works (Brief Explanation)

- User inputs an arithmetic expression using the calculator buttons.
- The input is validated to ensure only allowed characters are used.
- JavaScript evaluates the expression and displays the result.
- If the input is invalid, an error message is shown to the user.

## How to Run the Project

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open the `.html` file in any modern web browser
3. Start using the calculator

## Limitations

- Binary numbers are treated as numeric input and evaluated mathematically
- Advanced conversions (e.g. binary to decimal conversion display) are not included
